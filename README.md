COE Job Fair Application

## Student Register
This application is to be run on laptops at the Whitacre College of Engineering Registration booth.  Students will swipe their student IDs, which will look up their information on the database, and print out a label for their name tag.


## Employer Register
This software also works for employers. Employers input their information into a form which when complete prints out their information on a label and stores their info in the database.
